## Overview
The components of this product consist of the aluminum housing, light dissipator, and power switch.

### Aluminum Housing
The aluminum housing was designed to be manufactured with turnkey product services like JLCPCB or PCBWAY who provide CNC machining services for low volume product development. For this design a dark grey anodized finish was placed after the bead blasting process was completed. Changes to color and surface finish may be made, however it is important for the housing to be made in aluminum to assist in the heat transfer and dissipation for the aluminum LED PCB fixed to the front of the design. Although temperature sensors are placed throughout the design, the generated heat may become unmanagable or even dangerous due to the proximity of the LIPO battery to the heat source. Algorithmic changes have been implemented to help prevent device from overheating, however a good mechanical design is the only true solution to this problem.

### Light Dissipator
This component will endure a large amount of heat stress due to the temperature fluctuations nearby. As a result a temperature resistant plastic is recomended, one like PETG or Polycarbonate. This component may be CNC machined or 3D printed depending on final finish desires.

### Power Switch
This component may be CNC machined or 3D printed depending on final finish desires.
